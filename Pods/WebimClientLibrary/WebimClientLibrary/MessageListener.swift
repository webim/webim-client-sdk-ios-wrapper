     - important:
     Notice that this is a logical insertion of a message. I.e. calling this method does not necessarily mean receiving a new (unread) message. Moreover, at the first call `MessageTracker.getNextMessages(byLimit:completion:) most often the last messages of a local history (i.e. which is stored on a user's device) are returned, and this method will be called for each message received from a server after a successful connection.
     - parameter newMessage:
     Added message.
     - parameter previousMessage:
     A message before which it is needed to make a message insert. If nil then an insert is performed at the end of the list.

     `Message` is an immutable type and field values can not be changed. That is why message changing occurs as replacing one object with another. Thereby you can find out, for example, which certain message fields have changed by comparing an old and a new object values.
     - parameter oldVersion:
     Message changed from.
     - parameter newVersion:
     Message changed to.
