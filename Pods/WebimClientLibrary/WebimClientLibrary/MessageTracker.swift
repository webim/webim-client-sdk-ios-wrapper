 MessageTracker has two purposes:
 - it allows to request the messages which are above in the history;
 - it defines an interval within which message changes are transmitted to the listener (see `MessageStream.new(messageTracker messageListener:)`).
 - SeeAlso:
 `MessageStream.new(messageTracker messageListener:)`
