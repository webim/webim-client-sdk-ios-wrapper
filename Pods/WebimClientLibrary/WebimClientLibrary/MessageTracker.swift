 MessageTracker has two purposes:
 - it allows to request the messages which are above in the history;
 - it defines an interval within which message changes are transmitted to the listener (see `MessageStream.new(messageTracker messageListener:)`).

 `MessageStream.new(messageTracker messageListener:)`

     If there is any previous `MessageTracker` request that is not completed of limit of messages is less than 1, this method will do nothing.
     - important:
     Notice that this method can not be called again until the callback for the previous call will be invoked.

     A callback.

     `AccessError.INVALID_THREAD` if the method was called not from the thread the `WebimSession` was created in.
     `AccessError.INVALID_SESSION` if the method was called after `WebimSession` object was destroyed.
